-  # ðŸŽ¯ Steps in a Machine Learning Project:
1. ### **Design:** In the design step, you are considering the problem at handâ€”to decide whether or not you'll need a machine learning algorithm to achieve the objective.
2. ### **Train**: Once you decide on using a machine learning algorithm, you train the model and optimize its performance on the validation dataset.
3. ### **Operate**: The operate state captures the performance of the model after it's deployed.

- # ðŸ’» Environment preparation:
- ### [Azure](https://github.com/ahmadSoliman94/mlops/tree/main/1-intro/Azure)

- # Download and predict Data
### After the Prepartions i can download any data set using:
```wegt (dataset-link)```
