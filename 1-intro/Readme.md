-  # 🎯 Steps in a Machine Learning Project:
1. ### **Design:** In the design step, you are considering the problem at hand—to decide whether or not you'll need a machine learning algorithm to achieve the objective.
2. ### **Train**: Once you decide on using a machine learning algorithm, you train the model and optimize its performance on the validation dataset.
3. ### **Operate**: The operate state captures the performance of the model after it's deployed.
